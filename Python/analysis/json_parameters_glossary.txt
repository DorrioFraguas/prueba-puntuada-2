align_bluelight 	# bool, Align bluelight conditions
omit_strains 		# list, List of strains in 'analyse_variables' to omit from the analysis
dates 			# list, List of imaging dates to use for analysis. If None, all dates will be investigated
runs 			# list, List of imaging run numbers to use for analysis. If None, all runs will be investigated
test 			# str, Choose between 'LMM' (if >1 day replicate), 'ANOVA' or 'Kruskal'. Kruskal tests performed if is_normal=None and data is not Gaussian. t-tests performed if significant features are found.
